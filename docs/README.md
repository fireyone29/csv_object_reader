Writing Documentation
=====================

csv_object_reader uses [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) to generated
documentation. Sphinx can be installed via `pip install sphinx` after
which `html` docs can be generated by running `make html` in the
directory containing this file.  The sphinx
[autodoc](http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html) functionality is
used to parse docstrings.


API Documentation
-----------------

API Documentation is auto-generated with the sphinx
[autosummary](http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autosummary.html)
extension. This requires stub files (stored in `doc/api`) which
describe all the modules and packages in the project. Thus, if any new
packages or modules are introduced, you need to regenerate those
files. To do so, go to the root of the repository and run `make docs`
then commit the changes to `doc/api`.
